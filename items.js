      "description": "Whiskey Barrel Personalized Wedding Tie Clip For Groom Tie Clip Wood Tie Clip Monogram Custom Tie Clip Groom Gifts 5th Anniversary Tie Clip.\n\nPersonalized Wedding Tie Clip. Keep your love of whiskey close at hand with these retired Kentucky bourbon barrel accessories. This is the perfect present for groomsmen, best man, fathers day, or 5th anniversary. These personalized whiskey tie clips are handcrafted, one at a time in my home shop. Please keep in mind that yours may look slightly different than the one pictured.  \n\n\n- Item: Personalized Whiskey Barrel Tie Clip\n- Length: 2 inches\n- Width: 1/4 inch (.25&quot;)\n- Polished stainless steel clip\n- Tie Clip is delivered in a gift box and ready to gift right out of the mail!\n\n\nThis set features the name initials, but we can do phrases, dates, and graphics as well, just know that the font size would need to be slightly smaller to accommodate this.\n\n\n★HOW TO ORDER (READ CAREFULLY!!!!):★\n\n1. Purchase the listing by selecting the quantity you&#39;d like from the &quot;Quantity&quot; drop down menu. \n\n2. Enter the initials of each set you&#39;d like in the &quot;Notes to Seller&quot; section during checkout. \n★★★★★★IMPORTANT!!!!!! ★★★★★★★\nPlease put each set on a new line with no other punctuation (don&#39;t list &quot;set 1, set 2&quot;, use quotation marks or anything other than exactly what you want on each tie clip). Putting each set&#39;s initials on a different line is sufficient for differentiating and reduces the chances of errors. \nExample:\nAKG\nRSL\nGH\nMB\nLM\n\n\n\n\nDon&#39;t forget to add a set of cufflinks for the whole look! Personalized Whiskey Tie Clip, cufflinks, and money clip sets make great gifts for your groomsman to wear at the wedding!",

        "description": "Whiskey Barrel Personalized Wedding Tie Clip For Groom Tie Clip Wood Tie Clip Monogram Custom Tie Clip Groom Gifts 5th Anniversary Tie Clip.\n\nPersonalized Wedding Tie Clip. Keep your love of whiskey close at hand with these retired Kentucky bourbon barrel accessories. This is the perfect present for groomsmen, best man, fathers day, or 5th anniversary. These personalized whiskey tie clips are handcrafted, one at a time in my home shop. Please keep in mind that yours may look slightly different than the one pictured.  \n\n\n- Item: Personalized Whiskey Barrel Tie Clip\n- Length: 2 inches\n- Width: 1/4 inch (.25&quot;)\n- Polished stainless steel clip\n- Tie Clip is delivered in a gift box and ready to gift right out of the mail!\n\n\nThis set features the name initials, but we can do phrases, dates, and graphics as well, just know that the font size would need to be slightly smaller to accommodate this.\n\n\n★HOW TO ORDER (READ CAREFULLY!!!!):★\n\n1. Purchase the listing by selecting the quantity you&#39;d like from the &quot;Quantity&quot; drop down menu. \n\n2. Enter the initials of each set you&#39;d like in the &quot;Notes to Seller&quot; section during checkout. \n★★★★★★IMPORTANT!!!!!! ★★★★★★★\nPlease put each set on a new line with no other punctuation (don&#39;t list &quot;set 1, set 2&quot;, use quotation marks or anything other than exactly what you want on each tie clip). Putting each set&#39;s initials on a different line is sufficient for differentiating and reduces the chances of errors. \nExample:\nAKG\nRSL\nGH\nMB\nLM\n\n\n\n\nDon&#39;t forget to add a set of cufflinks for the whole look! Personalized Whiskey Tie Clip, cufflinks, and money clip sets make great gifts for your groomsman to wear at the wedding!",
