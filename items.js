All raw materials are proudly sourced from US suppliers.  \n \nOutside of our staple line, we enjoy offering unique, limited edition leathers. Due to the nature of working with natural materials, each item is unique and one of a kind.\n\nWhen we&#39;re not making bags, we&#39;re running around Lady Bird Lake, dancing our hearts out in the local honky tonks, or hopping into Barton Springs.\nWe love what we do!  We hope you do, too. \n\nA FAMILY TRADITION\n\nA Family Tradition\nOur shop is the namesake of two true American entrepreneurs, George Hatton Vaught and George Henry Vaught (Vanessa&#39;s Grandpa). Better known to the saddle making world as G.H. Vaught & Son, they produced saddles, harnesses, men&#39;s belts, and more out of their Rockwall, Texas-based leather workshop for nearly 100 years.  \n\nHatton Henry is dedicated to them. ♡\n\n•     •     •     •     •     •     •     •     •     •     •     •     \n\n• All Content ©2013-2019 Hatton Henry •",

This only makes the shipping transit time faster. \n\nIf you have any questions about your order or the information above, please feel free to message me!\n\nWILL I RECEIVE AN ART PROOF?\nAll custom designed orders and orders that take personalizations will receive an art proof sent via Etsy messenger within 24 hours of ordering. We will not engrave or ship any item or orders that we have not received art approval for. ***Please note: Failure to approve your art proof in a timely manner will cause production delays and add additional processing time to your order.\n\nWHAT IF MY ITEM ARRIVES BROKEN?\nAlthough it is rare that our items arrive broken or damaged, it occasionally can occur. Should your item(s) arrive damaged or broken we will replace that item(s) for you at no charge. We must be notified within 2 days upon receipt of shipment. We will need photos sent to us of the damaged/broken item as well as photos of the packaging.  We will file a claim with the shipping carrier, so please be sure to save all shipping cartons and packaging for inspection purposes.\n\nENGRAVING AND GLASS QUALITY?\nLone Star Etch has a commitment to quality and we want you to be pleased with your order. To this end, any defects in our engraving will be corrected as quickly as possible, and without charge. \n\n***PLEASE NOTE:  The following are typical characteristics of molded glassware and are not considered flaws, defects, or imperfections. (LSE will not offer refunds or replacements.)\n\n• LITTLE BUMPS: Occasionally, a molded piece of glass will have a tiny bump or two.  This is occurs during the manufacturing process and is quite common in molded glassware.\n\n• TINY BUBBLES: Tiny bubbles that are suspended in the glass are called seeds and are caused by gasses trapped in the molten glass during the manufacturing process. Seeds are quite common.",

I generally ship first class USPS for international shipments under 4 pounds (a mug is 2 pounds when packed for shipping), and priority for shipments over 4 pounds (10&quot; cake stands are 7 pounds when packed for shipping.)

Generally speaking international orders will take anywhere from 2-6 weeks for delivery depending on customs in your country.

How it works is.. The most expensive item will be full price shipping cost and you will receive discounts on the others. You will see the discounts in your cart when you checkout ; )\r\n\r\nWhat do I do if my package is showing &quot;delivered&quot; on USPS tracking and I never received it?\r\n~ We only use USPS (United States Postal Service) as our postal carrier, so you will need to contact them directly to put a search claim in since we don&#39;t physically deliver packages we cannot be liable for any any lost or stolen goods in transit. \r\n\r\nWhat if I need to change my address?\r\n~Please contact us as soon as possible.

All of the antler has been naturally shed and ethically obtained and the bison horn has been sourced from local farmers. Threads of carbon fiber, a simple and beautiful material, lend longevity and contrast to the pieces. Rings that feature stainless steel are done in collaboration with my brother Joel Liss, a local metal fabricator. \r\n\r\nWe remain passionate about our work and take pride in each creation.

        "policy_refunds": "**Please note that by making a purchase from our shop, you are agreeing to the policies below.**\r\n\r\nGUARANTEE\r\nOur rings are guaranteed against breaks due to craftsmanship errors for up to 5 months. A repair or replacement ring will be sent in the event of a craftsmanship error. Accidental breaks or scratches caused by owner negligence are not guaranteed by this. Please follow our care instructions above to preserve the durability and beauty of your ring.\r\n\r\nCANCELLING AN ORDER\r\nPlease contact us as soon as possible If you need to cancel an order. A full refund will be given if the ring has not already been started. Only a partial refund will be given if the ring has been started, and no refund will be given if the ring has already been completed.\r\n\r\nOVERDUE ORDERS\r\nUpdated manufacturing times are provided on the shop’s front page, outlining the latest time your order will be shipped from the date of purchase. These timeframes may vary depending on the season and do not account for any unforeseen delays such as illness or broken bones. It hasn&#39;t happened yet, but in the event that a situation like this arises we will contact you to discuss the best course of action.\r\n\r\nSIZING\r\nProviding the correct ring size is the responsibility of the customer. Prior to placing your order please ensure you have the finger sized correctly, ideally by a professional at a jewellery store. Your ring will be made to the size you order, and exchanges or returns will not be offered if the incorrect size was provided. However, if an error in sizing was made in the manufacturing of the ring, we will offer to remake or re-size the ring at no cost.\r\n\r\nIf a wood, antler, or carbon fiber ring is too small, it can usually be enlarged by about a half size. The ring can be sent back to be assessed and resized at the cost of shipping, which is the responsibility of the customer. Stainless steel and silver rings cannot be resized at all. \r\n\r\nAPPEARANCE\r\nPlease be advised that your ring will not look exactly the same as the one pictured, and no refund will be given for issues with the appearance of your item (ie. the colouration or look of the wood). We guarantee the ring you order is made with the exact same species of wood or antler used in the pictures, however these are natural materials and each piece possesses its own unique grains and colours. Carbon fiber is also hand wrapped, which provides a slightly different pattern each time. This ensures your ring is absolutely unique, but it also makes it impossible for each ring to be made the exact same twice.",
        "policy_additional": "RING INFO & CARE\r\n\r\nThe most important thing to remember is that these rings are not made of metal. However, if you are conscious of when and how you wear them there is no reason they can&#39;t last a lifetime. Here are a few tips for taking care of your ring:\r\n\r\nCarbon Fiber and Wood/Antler Ring: Some Care\r\nPairing carbon fiber with wood and antler adds considerable strength and durability to the natural materials. The rings in this style can be worn for just about every activity. Hand washing, showering and swimming are all fine and will not compromise the integrity of the ring. However, these activities may alter the look and tone of the wood over time so do so at your discretion. We advise removing this style of ring when submerging your hands in water for extended periods, like washing the dishes, and any sort of heavy or rough work with your hands that could scratch the wood badly. \r\n\r\nClassic Wood & Antler Rings: Moderate Care \r\nEach ring is coated with a highly durable, water resistant finish known as cyanoacrylate. This finish is regarded as one of the best wooden finishes on the market, however, it is subject to wear over time. We recommend following these care instructions to ensure your ring looks great and lasts for years:\r\n\r\n- Avoid prolonged exposure to water - take your ring off before showering, or doing dishes.\r\n- Avoid contact with soap and harsh chemicals, such as hand sanitizer.\r\n- Avoid sharp impacts - take off your ring before any heavy lifting or rough activity.\r\n\r\nYou may notice that the water resistant finish chips away from the antler sections of your ring more quickly than it does on the wood. This is due to differences in material and fortunately is not a major concern. Antler does not require the same level of moisture protection that wood does and by following the care instructions, there should not be an issue with its integrity. \r\n\r\nCarbon Fiber and Steel Rings: Minimal Care\r\nCarbon fiber rings are waterproof and highly durable. They are resistant to scratches and scuffs, and can sustain heavy impacts, but can become dented or scraped if rubbed against metal or other hard materials. \r\n\r\nRe-finishing\r\nSurface scratches or dulling of the glossy finish will not be covered by refunds or exchanges, however a finish can be reapplied for you at any time for $30. This covers refinishing as well as return shipping.\r\n\r\n\r\nRING FAQ&#39;s\r\n\r\nQ: &quot;How long will it take for me to receive my ring?&quot;\r\n\r\nA: Production times outlining the latest time your order will be shipped from the date of purchase can be found in our shop announcement on our front page: www.etsy.com/shop/OriginHG\r\n\r\nProduction time does not include shipping time. \r\n\r\nPriority Manufacturing Upgrade\r\nIf you need your ring sooner than the current production time, you can purchase the priority manufacturing upgrade to guarantee your ring will be made in 16 days or less. This option CANNOT be added to any ring that features steel or silver lining. Click on the link below to add priority manufacturing to your order.\r\nhttps://www.etsy.com/ca/listing/113316967/prioritize-an-item-to-be-made-more?ref=shop_home_active_1\r\n\r\n\r\nQ: “Can my ring be refinished?”\r\n\r\nA: All of our wood and antler rings come with a water resistant finish on or in them (depending on the style) but because we use our hands so much everyday over time these finishes can wear down.\r\n\r\nWe make some rings out of just wood, with no carbon fiber backing. These rings have a glossy surface finish of cyanoacrylate (superglue) and cannot be refinished or touched up at home. If you find that your wood ring is looking a little tired or scuffed up you can send it back for refinishing. Please contact us for prices and timelines. \r\n\r\nWoods that are paired with carbon fiber have been infused with resin for an invisible finish that leaves them looking and feeling natural. If you find your wood and carbon ring is darkening and you’d like to breathe some life back into it then a light polishing with a fine grit sanding sponge will do a good job of that. You can also rub the wood with Danish or Tung oil to brighten the grains again. In extreme cases it may be necessary to send the ring to back to us for a touch up on the lathe. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKNIFE INFO & CARE\r\n\r\nOrigin blades are made using high carbon, or tool steel. This family of steels is known for their edge retention and durability. Unlike stainless steel, these blades will naturally oxidize over time, and age with a beautiful patina. Special care needs to be taken in order to prevent corrosion or rust on the blade. Each Origin knife is made with great care, and with the same treatment at home they can develop their own unique character over time, and last for decades.\r\n\r\nMost of our knife handles feature a variety of woods from around the world, but they also incorporate metals, like brass, or composite materials such as micarta. We also use deer or moose antler in many of our pieces. Wood has always been the main focus for us though. We love the endless variety of beautiful forms that nature provides. \r\n\r\n- Clean your knife often and thoroughly. Clean the blade off with plain water, and dry well after each use. Periodically wipe the blade off during use, especially if you are cutting anything that’s acidic. If left on the blade for too long, acidic juice will oxidize the steel and leave permanent dark spots. Clean and dry the handle as often as the blade. Although some handles are water resistant, keeping them clean and dry will help them last longer.\r\n- Keep your knife dry. Don’t leave your knife in the sink, or submerged in dishwater. This can cause the knife to dull quickly, and it will lead to rust. Don’t put your knife in the dishwasher. This will compromise the integrity of the steel and handle.\r\n- Store your knife carefully. The absolute best place to store your knife is on a magnetic rack. Do not store your knife loose in a drawer with other utensils. This is one of the fastest ways to dull a good knife. Apply mineral oil to the blade with a soft cloth to prevent corrosion if you are storing it for long periods. \r\n- Keep your knife sharp. Your knife will arrive razor sharp. The best way to maintain its edge is by regularly honing the blade using a leather strop, or a honing rod, on a weekly basis. When your knife needs to be sharpened, an oil or water sharpening stone will do the trick, but these methods do take practice. We offer a free lifetime sharpening service on any of our knives up to two times annually. You just pay the shipping. \r\n\r\nKnife Guarantee\r\nOur knives are designed with extensive, everyday use in mind, and come with an everyday structural guarantee. If for some reason our knives fail to perform as they should, we will replace or repair them at no cost to you. Please note, this service is not offered if a knife is being misused or neglected. To ensure your knife lasts as long as you do, please follow the steps for proper care, noted above.",
